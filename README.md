Rock Paper Scissors

Contains basic logic and UI using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For the html, I created 4 main sections stored in div containers. This helped me capitalized on flexbox when styling and creating the UI with CSS.

An overview of the game-

The user will select one out of 3 buttons. Once they click on any 3 button, it will initiate the game. Here are the following things happening behind the scenes for each button clicked:
* The user's chosen button is stored for comparison later on i.e. "Rock"
* A random option is chosen for the computer's pick
* The user's choice is compared to the computer
* A display will show indicating who's won
* Scores are also updated
* Once user/computer reaches 5 points, game ends
